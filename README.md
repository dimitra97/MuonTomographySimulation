# MuonTomographySimulation
In this repository the source code from the simulation of a muon tomography application is presented and the results, as well.

The software toolkit used for this application is the Geant4 (https://geant4.web.cern.ch/) along with the ROOT 6.24/0.2 data analysis framework (https://root.cern/). 
The method used is the muon scattering tomography for the imaging of a lead cube and the experimental set-up is given in the picture below. The algorithm performed for the imaging of the object is the POCA algorithm which assumes a single scattering point for the recorded muons.
